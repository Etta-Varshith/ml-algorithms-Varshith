## K-Means Clustering on Iris Dataset

This project performs K-Means Clustering on the famous **Iris dataset** using `scikit-learn`. It evaluates clustering quality using:

- Inertia: Sum of squared distances to the nearest cluster center
- Silhouette Score: Measures how similar a point is to its own cluster vs others

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## Output

- Prints Inertia and Silhouette Score
- Displays cluster labels for each data point
- Shows a 2D scatter plot of the clusters using Sepal Length and Sepal Width
