# k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) on Wine Dataset

This project demonstrates the use of the **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)** algorithm to classify wines into three categories based on 13 chemical properties. The Wine dataset, available in **scikit-learn**, contains 178 instances, each with 13 features such as alcohol content, malic acid, and proline. The objective is to classify the wines into three different classes (cultivars) based on these features.

## Requirements

To run the project, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib` (if you wish to visualize the confusion matrix)

pip install numpy scikit-learn matplotlib

## Dataset Overview
The Wine dataset contains 178 samples of wine and 13 chemical features. The objective is to classify these samples into three different classes of wine.

## Accuracy : 96.30%
