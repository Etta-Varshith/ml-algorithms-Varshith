## Polynomial Regression - Hours vs Exam Scores

This project demonstrates **Polynomial Regression** for predicting **student exam scores** based on the number of **hours studied**. The dataset is synthetic and it is created in such a way that it contains a relationship between the number of hours studied and exam scores.

The goal of this project is to apply polynomial regression (degree 2, degree 3, and degree 4) to the dataset and visualize how well the different polynomial degrees fit the data.

## ðŸ“Š **Dataset**

The dataset consists of 200 rows with the following two features:

- **Hours Studied**: The number of hours a student studied for an exam.
- **Exam Scores**: The scores obtained by the student in the exam.


The dataset is stored as `scores.csv`.
